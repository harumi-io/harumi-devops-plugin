# DevOps Plugin

You have the **harumi-devops-plugin** installed. This plugin provides DevOps skills for harumi's infrastructure and Kubernetes operations.

## Managed Repositories

This plugin manages two repositories:

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `harumi-io/infrastructure` | Terraform IaC (AWS) — VPC, ECS, EKS, RDS, IAM, DNS |
| `harumi-io/harumi-k8s` | Kubernetes manifests, ArgoCD apps, Helm values, Grafana dashboards |

Read the active repo config (injected at session start) for cluster names, contexts, endpoints, and naming conventions. The hook loads `harumi.yaml` when present, otherwise falls back to the legacy `.devops.yaml`. Trust the reported **config source** and any **prerequisite warnings** in the session context over stale docs or examples.

If the session context contains a `## Prerequisites` section, interpret it as follows:
- `⚠ BLOCKING:` — stop all work immediately and ask the user to resolve this before continuing. The only blocking condition is a missing repo config, because without it the plugin cannot give accurate project-specific guidance.
- `⚠ Warning:` — proceed with awareness of the limitation (e.g. kubeconfig is present but unreadable).
- Any other line — informational; no action required.

Live cluster and AWS access is **not assumed**. Missing `kubectl`, an absent kubeconfig, or locally unconfigured contexts are normal states. The assistant can still produce manifests, Terraform, runbooks, and other guidance without live cluster reads.

## Drift Detection

If the drift detection section below reports drift, invoke `harumi-devops-plugin:sync-docs` **before** proceeding with any other work. This ensures documentation is up to date before making further changes.

When `sync-docs` runs, it queries AWS and Kubernetes **independently** and uses the best available reading per surface. Live AWS state (account metadata, EKS clusters, ECR registries) is preferred for AWS-sourced fields when the `aws` CLI and credentials are present; live Kubernetes state is preferred for cluster-sourced fields when `kubectl` contexts are configured. When a source is unreachable, `sync-docs` falls back to repo data for that surface and explicitly reports "live drift could not be verified for [AWS / Kubernetes]" — it does not treat missing access as all-or-nothing. Do not assume either live source is present for every session.

## Cluster Read-Access Rules

When locally configured kubectl contexts are available, skills may use them for **read-only** cluster access. Live cluster access is not assumed — skills must work usefully without it.

**Allowed commands:**
- `kubectl get`, `kubectl describe`, `kubectl logs`, `kubectl top`
- `argocd app get`, `argocd app list`
- `helm list`, `helm get values`
- `curl` against observability endpoints (from the active repo config's `observability.endpoints`)

**Forbidden commands (require handoff to user):**
- `kubectl apply`, `kubectl delete`, `kubectl edit`, `kubectl patch`, `kubectl create`
- `helm install`, `helm upgrade`, `helm uninstall`
- `argocd app sync`, `argocd app delete`

## Universal Safety Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These apply to ALL DevOps skills:

1. **Never run `terraform apply` or `terraform destroy`** — Always provide a handoff with the exact command for the user to execute
2. **Never `kubectl delete` or any write operation without explicit user confirmation** — this applies to ALL environments (production, staging, development). No exceptions.
3. **Never push images to production registries without confirmation**
4. **When live access is available, verify current state before making changes** — If `aws` CLI or `kubectl` access is present, use it to confirm resource existence and configuration; otherwise state assumptions explicitly and ask the user to verify
5. **Always present the handoff pattern for destructive actions:**

```
Configuration ready for apply!

Execute: cd [path] && terraform apply -var-file=[tfvars]
Changes: [summary]
Verification: [CLI commands to confirm]
```

## Parallel Agent Dispatch

When a user request spans multiple independent domains, dispatch agents in parallel for faster results and cleaner context isolation. Each agent runs the corresponding skill in a fresh context window.

### Agent Inventory

| Agent | Skill | Typical Use |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `run-kubernetes` | `harumi-devops-plugin:kubernetes` | K8s investigation, manifest work |
| `run-infrastructure` | `harumi-devops-plugin:infrastructure` | Terraform state, IaC changes |
| `run-observability` | `harumi-devops-plugin:observability` | Metrics, logs, incident investigation |
| `run-argocd` | `harumi-devops-plugin:argocd` | Sync status, GitOps operations |
| `run-debug-pod` | `harumi-devops-plugin:debug-pod` | Pod troubleshooting |
| `run-deploy-app` | `harumi-devops-plugin:deploy-app` | App onboarding |

### Compatibility Matrix

| Agents | Parallel? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| `run-infrastructure` + `run-kubernetes` | Yes | Independent targets |
| `run-kubernetes` + `run-observability` | Yes | Common in incident investigation |
| `run-infrastructure` + `run-observability` | Yes | No shared write targets |
| `run-argocd` + `run-kubernetes` | Yes | Investigation compatible |
| `run-deploy-app` + `run-debug-pod` (same app) | No | Sequence: debug first |
| Any two agents writing to the same resource | No | Always sequential |

### Dispatch Rules

When the user request maps to 2+ compatible skills:

1. **Identify** the relevant agents from the inventory
2. **Check compatibility** using the matrix — if agents are compatible, dispatch in parallel; if not, sequence them
3. **Dispatch** compatible agents simultaneously using the Agent tool, passing the specific task and context as inputs to each
4. **Collect** all results before executing any write operations
5. **Sequence writes** — execute writes one at a time, respecting declared dependencies

### Error Handling

**Parallel agent failure:**
1. Preserve and display results from successful agents
2. Name the failed agent and its error explicitly
3. Ask the user whether to proceed with partial results or abort
4. Never silently proceed into write operations with incomplete information

**Write failure:**
1. Surface the full error
2. Stop the write sequence
3. Present a manual recovery handoff command for the user to execute

**No silent retries.** All error recovery is user-gated.

## Configuration

The active repo config (loaded at session start) tells you:
- **AWS account** — account ID, region, alias
- **Terraform settings** — version, state backend, state bucket, var file, module paths
- **Clusters** — names, contexts, environments, domains, registries
- **ArgoCD** — gitops repo, app-of-apps paths
- **Observability endpoints** — Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Alertmanager URLs
- **Naming pattern** — how resources are named

The hook prefers `harumi.yaml`; if absent it loads the legacy `.devops.yaml`. The session context reports which file was loaded. Any missing repo config is surfaced as `⚠ BLOCKING:` in `## Prerequisites` — work must stop until the human provides one. Kubernetes access status (kubectl availability, context presence) is reported as informational or `⚠ Warning:` only; live cluster access is not assumed.
