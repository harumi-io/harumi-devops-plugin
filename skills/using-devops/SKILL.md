# DevOps Plugin

You have the **claude-devops-plugin** installed. This plugin provides DevOps-oriented skills for infrastructure, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and cloud operations.

## Available Skills

Use the Skill tool to invoke these when triggered:

| Skill | Trigger | Use When |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `claude-devops-plugin:infrastructure` | `.tf` files, Terraform, AWS/GCP/Azure infra | Creating, modifying, or reviewing Terraform/IaC configurations |
| `claude-devops-plugin:setup-devops-config` | User asks to create/set up `.devops.yaml`; no config exists | Setting up the plugin for a new repo |

**Future skills** (not yet available):
- `kubernetes` — K8s manifests, Helm charts, ArgoCD/Flux
- `cicd` — CI/CD pipeline configs, deployment workflows
- `cost-optimization` — Resource sizing, cost analysis
- `observability` — Monitoring, alerting, dashboards
- `security-operations` — IAM, secrets, compliance
- `containers` — Dockerfiles, image builds, registries

## Trigger Rules

Invoke `claude-devops-plugin:infrastructure` when you encounter ANY of:
- `.tf` files or Terraform discussions
- AWS, GCP, or Azure infrastructure tasks
- IaC changes, module creation, state management
- Infrastructure migrations or zero-downtime changes
- Cost or security review of cloud resources

Invoke `claude-devops-plugin:setup-devops-config` when you encounter ANY of:
- User asks to create, generate, or set up `.devops.yaml`
- User says "configure the plugin" or "set up devops config"
- No `.devops.yaml` exists and the user is setting up the plugin for the first time

## Universal Safety Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These apply to ALL DevOps skills:

1. **Never run `terraform apply` or `terraform destroy`** — Always provide a handoff with the exact command for the user to execute
2. **Never `kubectl delete` in production without explicit user confirmation**
3. **Never push images to production registries without confirmation**
4. **Always verify current state before making changes** — Use CLI commands (aws, gcloud, az, kubectl) to confirm resource existence and configuration
5. **Always present the handoff pattern for destructive actions:**

```
Configuration ready for apply!

Execute: cd [path] && terraform apply -var-file=[tfvars]
Changes: [summary]
Verification: [CLI commands to confirm]
```

## Configuration

The active `.devops.yaml` config (loaded at session start) tells you:
- **Cloud provider** — which CLI commands to use (aws, gcloud, az)
- **Terraform settings** — version, state backend, var file
- **Naming pattern** — how resources are named
- **Stack details** — K8s tool, CI/CD platform, observability stack, container runtime

Read config values to adapt your guidance to the user's specific stack.

## Relationship to Superpowers

This plugin is **domain-oriented** (how to do DevOps). Superpowers is **process-oriented** (how to work: TDD, debugging, planning). They complement each other. Use superpowers skills for workflow (brainstorming, planning, debugging) and devops skills for domain knowledge (Terraform patterns, cloud architecture, security).
